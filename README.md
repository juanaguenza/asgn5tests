# Tests for assignment 5
## First 3 tests are the example cases given to us in the doc
### Please look over the next 3 to ensure accuracy (I did these tests based off my understanding -> Will add more in the future if tests are not released to us / someone doesn't make better tests)
    -> Ensure you already have an executable in your working directory
    run the tests 'python3 test.py'
